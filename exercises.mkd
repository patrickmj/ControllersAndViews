# Controllers And Views

## Create the missing views for the Whatnot_Controller

* need views to go along with the showAction and browseAction
* pass in some fake data to display by implementing the actions

## Play with different default models

* The example steals data from Items. Try it with Collections and Tags and see what happens.
** fix things that break
** look at the Collections and Tags models to see what other data you can display
